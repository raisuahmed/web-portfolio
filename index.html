    <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>
    <p>You just graduated and you are ready to start your career in the IT field. 
        I cannot spoiler anything, but I assure you it will be an interesting ride. 
        I’m writing you this letter because I want to give you some advice that will 
        help you be a better professional. Nothing you won’t learn by yourself in 
        the next few years, but it is something that I wish someone had told me when 
        I started my career. They are not ordered by any means and are all equally important.</p>
